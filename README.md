## ⚠️ Important Considerations

### GitHub Terms of Service

- This tool creates legitimate commits with real content
- All commits include proper attribution and timestamps
- Repositories are created transparently in your account
- Follows GitHub's guidelines for automated content

### Best Practices

- Use meaningful repository names
- Don't create excessive patterns (be considerate)
- Understand that patterns become part of your public profile
- Consider the impact on your contribution statistics

### Limitations

- Patterns may take up to 24 hours to fully appear due to GitHub caching
- Limited to 53 weeks of history (GitHub's standard view)
- Requires public repositories for patterns to be visible in contribution graphs
- Cannot modify existing commits or repositories

## 🙋‍♂️ FAQ

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I delete repositories created by Commit Canvas?</strong></summary>

Yes! You have full control over repositories created by Commit Canvas. You can delete them directly from your GitHub account at any time. The patterns will disappear from your contribution graph accordingly.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How long does it take for patterns to appear?</strong></summary>

Patterns typically appear immediately, but GitHub's contribution graph cache may take up to 24 hours to fully update. This is a GitHub limitation, not specific to Commit Canvas.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Are the commits "real" commits?</strong></summary>

Yes! Commit Canvas creates legitimate Git commits with real content, proper timestamps, and author information. These are not fake or empty commits.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I use this with private repositories?</strong></summary>

While you can create private repositories, contributions to private repositories don't appear in your public contribution graph unless you enable "Private contributions" in your GitHub profile settings.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Does this violate GitHub's terms of service?</strong></summary>

No. Commit Canvas creates legitimate repositories with real commits and content. All activity is transparent and follows GitHub's guidelines for automated content creation.
